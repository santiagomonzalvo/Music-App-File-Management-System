# Music-App-File-Management-System
File Management System for a "music app" using C++ and libraries. It features a main menu with 5 sub-menus: Songs, Artists, Genres, Reports, and Configuration.
• The first three sub-menus offer functionalities for Adding, Modifying, Listing, and Deleting Records.
• The Reports sub-menu allows for file creation, record filtering, and additional features.
• The Configuration sub-menu allows for creating backups and restoring record files.
Collaboratively, my team and I completed this project adhering to delivery deadlines and quality standards set by the institution
